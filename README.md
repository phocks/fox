# fox.js

Some useful functions

For now this is just a list of some userful functions I've come across. I'm trying to put them into a package so I don't have to look for them on Google every time LOL.

To install type `npm install fox-js`

Then link in your code liek `const fox = require('fox-js')`

## Functions currently:

fox.setIntervalX(function, delay, count)
